## About Me  

Welcome to my blog. Iâ€™m a **physics major at York University, Canada**, deeply interested in **gravity-electromagnetic unification**, **cold atom physics**, and **biophotonics**. My current course involves **rubidium atom trapping techniques** and exploring **light-matter interactions**.  

Beyond physics, I have a strong passion for **coding**, primarily using **Python, MATLAB, LaTeX, and Markdown** for simulations, data analysis, and research documentation.  

Outside of science, Iâ€™m also a **songwriter**. Iâ€™ve collaborated with **talented artists and K-pop groups**, blending physics and creativity in unique ways.  

This blog is where I share insights from my research, programming experiments, and thoughts on the intersection of **science, technology, and music**.

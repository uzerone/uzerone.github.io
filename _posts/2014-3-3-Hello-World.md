title: Analyzing the Ozone Hole Over Antarctica

### Understanding Ozone Depletion  

The dataset I am analyzing focuses on the **ozone hole over Antarctica**, which includes measurements of the **number of ozone holes, their size, and time-based variations**. This data is crucial for understanding how the ozone layer is changing over time and the impact of environmental policies like the Montreal Protocol.  

I chose this dataset because **environmental issues demand attention**, and as inhabitants of Earth, we have a responsibility to monitor and mitigate the effects of ozone depletion. Tracking these trends helps researchers predict potential climate consequences and assess human-induced environmental damage.  

### Recommended Reading  

One key article from my literature review that provides valuable insights is **“Aura’s Instruments are Closely Monitoring Ozone”**, published by NASA. This article highlights how satellite instruments are continuously tracking ozone levels, contributing to our understanding of atmospheric changes and aiding in the development of environmental policies [1].  

Stay tuned for further analysis on trends and findings from this dataset!
